# Audience Profile

## Who They Are

**Primary**: Vibe coders — people who build with AI tools (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) without deep CS background. They can ship but don't fully understand what's happening under the hood.

**Secondary**: Non-technical AI builders — product managers, designers, founders who use no-code/low-code + AI to build. They need conceptual understanding, not implementation details.

**Common traits**:
- Learn by doing, not by reading docs
- Visual thinkers — diagrams > paragraphs
- Short attention spans — need frequent payoffs
- Already building things — not starting from zero
- Value "good enough" understanding over completeness
- Active on YouTube, Twitter/X, Discord

## Tone Rules

### Voice
- **Direct, not condescending** — "Here's how it works" not "Let me explain this simply"
- **Peer, not teacher** — "You've probably done this" not "Students should note"
- **Confident, not academic** — State things clearly, skip hedging
- **Practical, not theoretical** — Always connect to what they're building

### Language
- Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the viewer
- Avoid jargon without context — if you use a term, explain it immediately
- No filler phrases: "basically", "essentially", "in other words"
- No academic framing: "it is important to note", "one should consider"
- Short sentences preferred — max 15 words per line on screen

### Content Rules
- **Every concept needs an analogy** — "A database is like a spreadsheet on steroids"
- **Show the 'why' before the 'what'** — Why does this matter to them?
- **One concept per scene** — Never stack two ideas in one visual
- **Alternate dense and light scenes** — Heavy concept → visual metaphor → next concept
- **Real examples over abstract ones** — "Your Next.js app" not "a hypothetical system"
- **Acknowledge what they already know** — "You've used an API before — here's what's actually happening"

## Text Constraints

### On-Screen Text
- **Headings**: Max 6 words
- **Body text**: Max 15 words per line, max 2 lines
- **Code snippets**: Max 5 lines
- **Bullet points**: Max 8 words each, max 5 bullets per scene
- **Stats**: One number per scene

### Reading Time
- Minimum 3 seconds for any text on screen
- Add 1 second per additional line of text
- Code blocks need 50% more reading time than prose

## Content Progression Pattern

For any concept, follow this order:
1. **Hook** — Why should they care?
2. **Analogy** — Connect to something they know
3. **Explain** — The actual concept
4. **Show** — Visual/diagram/code
5. **Summarize** — One-line takeaway

Not every scene needs all 5, but the overall section should cover them.
